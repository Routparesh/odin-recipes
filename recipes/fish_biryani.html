        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h3>How to Make Malabar Fish Biryani</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take 250 gm onions and cut them into thin slices. Heat oil and 1/2 cup ghee in a pan, and fry the onion till golden brown. Fry cashew nuts and raisins and keep aside.</li>
            <li>Apply turmeric powder with enough salt and little water on the fish.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a frying pan. Lightly fry the fish till half done and keep aside.</li>
            <li>In a heavy-bottomed vessel, heat 3 tablespoons of oil. Grind the remaining onion in a blender with 1/2 cup water. Add this onion mixture to the hot oil.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile crush ginger, garlic and chillies. Add this paste to the onion mixture. Stir well for 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes, yoghurt and salt. Cook for some time till the water evaporates. Add the fried fish pieces, coriander leaves and the juice from the lemons. Keep aside.</li>
            <h3>For the Rice:</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Heat ghee in a non-stick vessel. Add 1/2 chopped onion, cardamoms and cinnamon. Immediately add the washed rice (drain without any water).</li>
            <li>Add boiled water (1:2 ratio) and salt and cook on high flame till the water is absorbed by the rice.</li>
            <li>Keep the rice covered for 10 minutes. Sprinkle garam masala powder over the rice.</li>
            <li>Now take a heavy bottomed vessel and add the cooked rice in one layer at the bottom. Add a few spoons of the fish masala. Toss some fried onion, nuts and raisins and a little garam masala powder and cover with a rice layer.</li>
            <li>Layer it up, finishing with the garnishes on top.</li>
            <li>Take a napkin (radius of the vessel), dampen it with water and a little rose water, and cover the vessel.</li>
            <li>Put the biryani on dum for 1 hour with light heat for the flavours to develop. Serve hot.</li>
